## OpenVest
### Vested Token Allocations for Employees

## Features
1. Create Vesting Account for the Company
2. Choose the start time, end time, cliff period and create vesting schedule for given employee
3. Employee can claim some % the token allocation after cliff ends, full allocation is unlocked at end time.

## How it works
Linear Vesting Schedule is followed, upon employee vesting account creation, tokens are locked in the treasury and can be claimed by the employee only after the cliff ends

At CLIFF: (C - S)/(E - S)% of total allocation
At ENDTIME: 100% OF TOTAL ALLOCATION
